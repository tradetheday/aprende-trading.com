#### 4. Practice makes Perfection

To obtain a benefit from price fluctuations rather than knowledge, practice is required. Too many people lose their hard earned capital because of those mistakes that had been foreseen in a demo account. Simulation accounts are the perfect place to familiarize yourself with market conditions and perfect a strategy.

In fact, one of the best secrets of daily success is first to execute prospective strategies through a simulator account. Financed with virtual money, you can identify failures and improve your technique until you generate consistent profits. Then you can apply it to a real account. These simulation accounts, by themselves, are not one of the best daily trading secrets; The secret is to use the [Oanda](https://www.oanda.com/lang/es/) practice account .

![7 secrets to a successful daily trading](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0259/1595/products/oanda_desktop1_1024x1024.PNG?v=1523904620)

Registration is fast and hassle free. It comes without fees and can be used for unlimited time. This ensures that you do not have to risk your own capital until you feel safe. You can also choose between the popular *MetaTrader 4* platform or your own platform. In addition, you can access your demo account through a mobile application.

But one of the best selling points is access to its advanced feature of 'Autochartist'. This allows you to build and improve a strategy using highly sophisticated tools and technical analysis. All this means that the Oanda demo accounts must include the trade secrets revealed in PDF every day.
#### 5. Trading Agenda

Many merchants care about the quantity and forget to sit down and observe the quality of their operations. Ignore the need to find out where and why they go wrong. This is the reason why in the secrets of daily transactions with stocks or any other instrument, an agenda with [TradeBench](https://tradebench.com/) should be [kept](https://tradebench.com/) at the top.

TradeBench is a totally free online trading agenda. You can plan operations, position sizes and it comes with a risk management software. The most important thing is that it keeps a detailed record of the previous operations, which include:

 - Entry and exit points

 - Trading data

 - Opening and closing time

 - Lost profit

This allows you to look back and identify flaws in your strategy. You can continuously improve by following this system, while others will continue to make the same mistakes.

You could say that any PDF file of trading secrets, opening an agenda with TradeBench should have a prominent place in the list.
#### 6. Stay Neutral

It's just lunchtime and you just lost $ 500 in an exchange. Now he is doubting his carefully formulated plan. On the other hand, when it is significantly up, maintaining that winning position seems to be the right thing, regardless of your strategy.

But as the successful trader Victor Sperandeo correctly stated, “ *The key to the success of trading is emotional discipline. If intelligence were the key, there would be many more people making money* . ” Developing a discipline similar to that of a monk is not one of the 7 most important secrets to daily success. Instead, the secret is knowing how to develop that emotional discipline.

For this, it is necessary to adopt a very limited approach and follow all the steps indicated below:

 - Stops : You must respect your stops. They force you to take a minute and focus on where and why you were wrong.

 - Consistency: you should outline your strategy at the beginning and follow it later. Trust your research and data.

 - Start small: focus on big profits and forget about the idea of ​​following the pattern. In the long term, taking smaller positions will give you greater control. Then, you can gradually increase the size of your position as your confidence grows.

 - Lifestyle: you must find a plan that fits your lifestyle. Seeing 50 graphics when you only have time for 5 is a guaranteed way to waste time and stress. Instead, focus on a few but good good opportunities will benefit you.

 - Reduce information: it is very easy to get entangled in large volumes of microdata. Breathe for a minute and concentrate your energy on the overall image.

 - Realistic goals: this is one of the best trading secrets. Unrealistic profit goals will quickly lead to reckless decision making. Set small and realistic goals, especially to get started.

 - Reduce losses: passing the autopilot and leaving is essential when threatened with large losses. Then, prepare yourself mentally and visualize that emergency exit. As Bruce Kovner noted, " *if you customize losses, you cannot operate* ."

 - Learn from the best: buy books on discipline development. The Disciplined Trader by Mark Douglas is an excellent read to start.

 - Trust yourself: although chat rooms and forums can be useful, don't get too influenced. If you spend a lot of time on these sites, you will quickly doubt your strategy when your capital is online.

 - General image: correct your bad habits and practice building that willpower in all aspects of life. This way you will see that staying neutral when operating is much easier.

#### 7. Automation

Once you have an effective and constant strategy, automation can be used to improve your returns. This is because you can only perform a certain number of operations manually each day. An algorithm can execute a large number of operations as soon as the predetermined criteria have been met.

In the world of automation, [AlgoTrader](https://www.algotrader.com/) is one of the best kept secrets. It was designed by industry experts and gives you maximum control of automated, high-speed, fact-based systems.
